First project of 1st year in C++ Programming. December 2024
Project coded in SFML and with OOP (Oriented Object Programming)

I decided to keep it and continue to improve it in my free time, I learn new things everyday so I change my architecture to be better.

About the game, it's a Shoot'em Up (A game where the main thing is to shoot things, getting popular with Space Invaders), you control a space ship
and you need to defeat the evil bosses, each of them has unique patterns and are pretty hard to beat but you'll be proud to win against.
