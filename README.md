First project of 1st year in C++ Programming. December 2024
Project coded in SFML and with OOP (Oriented Object Programming)

I decided to keep it and continue to improve it in my free time, I learn new things everyday so I change my architecture to be better.

About the game, it's a Shoot'em Up (A game where the main thing is to shoot things, getting popular with Space Invaders), you control a space ship
and you need to defeat the evil bosses, each of them has unique patterns and are pretty hard to beat but you'll be proud to win against.

The Hero will have some abilities to help him, like a Manabar which fill up over the time.
With it you'll have Skills you can unlock, each skill costs an amount of mana so you need to manage how to use them well.
For example the X2Balls Skill which double the shooting speed, or the Heal Skill which heals you 1 HP but is expensive.

Moreover you have a base of 5hp and each bullet receveid will do 1 damage.

Thank you for reading this and See you next Update :)
